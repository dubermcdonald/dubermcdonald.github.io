Hi there fellow microwave hiders! Today, I, Duber McDonald, would like to share with you some of the best tips on how to hide a microwave!

## Hiding Small Items are Easier than Hiding Large Ones
The first tip: invest into a mini microwave. It's really easy to hide small microwaves in small spaces around the city like pavement cracks. I of course, can't afford microwaves as I'm already severely in debt because of the negative tips I receive but maybe you're actually getting tipped and can purchase a microwave.

## Make Your Hiding Place as Inconspicious as Possible
If you can't find a large enough hole in the pavement, try to cover your microwave up with a blanket. Personally I recommend blankets of these colours:

In my personal experience, if you add a bright, flashing neon sign saying "there are no microwaves here" then people will assume there are no microwaves in the area and leave you alone.

## Lock Your Microwaves
Invest in a good, sturdy lock for a safe you can lock your microwave in. Once again, my debt is too severe to be able to afford a lock but I heard some really good lock combinations are `1234`, `1111`, `0000`, `1212`, `7777`, `1112`, and `1122` and some good passwords are: `123456`, `123456789`, `password`, `qwerty`, `picture1`, and `12345678`.
