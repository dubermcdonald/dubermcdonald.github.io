Hey guys, Duber McDonald here, turns out hiding microwaves wasn't as lucrative of a business as I thought, so as I sat in my crippling debt I thought to myself, "Why don't I just become one of those tech moguls, I mean it can't be that hard right?" And so by enlisting the services of a handful of talented (and rather unethical) high school students, I am proud to announce to you a new product. It's more than an app, it's an interface to your new life, an opportunity to make new friends and make new beginnings, this isn't just a chatting app, this is DuberChat

DuberChat will be bigger than Facebook, bigger than Instagram, bigger than WeChat! I've already sent emails to Zuckerberg and Tencent to declare war on them so they better watch out!
